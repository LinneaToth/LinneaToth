# 👋  Welcome!

I’m so glad you are here—whether you are a fellow dev, a curious visitor, or a future collaborator.
This profile is a living documentation of my pursuit of a lifelong dream that is finally in motion.

**I am passionate about thoughtful design** — both visually and in code. It has been a joy to discover how Vitruvius’ principles of strength, utility and beauty apply just as well to code as they do to architecture.

## 💻 So far, I have been focusing on: 
- React
- Tailwind
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Accessibility
- Designing user-centered UIs
- APIs
- OOP

Take a peek at my journey and feel free to explore the projects I’ve been working on!
