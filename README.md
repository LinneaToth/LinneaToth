- **CMS & APIs:** Payload CMS, API integration, async patterns  
- **UX & Design:** Figma, Accessibility, UX research & strategy, interaction design, visual psychology  
- **Foundations:** team collaboration and version control with git & GitHub

## 🔭 Coming up, later in this semester: 
- **Backend and database technology:** Node.js and SQL    
- **Mobile apps:** React Native
- **Agile project methodologies**   
  

## 💼 I am pre-loaded with:
- Experience with **project management** and strong collaboration skills
- **Design experience** spanning production, analysis and assessment
- **Communication and teaching experience** with a pedagogical mindset
- **Professional background as an architect** including municipal work and large-scale projects (on land and at sea aboard cruise ships)
